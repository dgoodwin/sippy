# changepoint [![PkgGoDev][godev-img]][godev] [![CI][ci-img]][ci]

Changepoint is a Go library for changepoint detection with support for
nonparametric distributions.

```go
package changepoint_test

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
	"math/rand"

	"pgregory.net/changepoint"
)

func ExampleNonParametric() {
	r := rand.New(rand.NewSource(0))

	var data []float64
	for i := 0; i < 20; i++ {
		data = append(data, math.Exp(r.NormFloat64()+1))
	}
	for i := 0; i < 60; i++ {
		data = append(data, math.Exp(r.NormFloat64()))
	}
	for i := 0; i < 20; i++ {
		data = append(data, math.Exp(r.NormFloat64()-1))
	}

	fmt.Println(changepoint.NonParametric(data, 1))

	// Output:
	// [14 78]
}
```
